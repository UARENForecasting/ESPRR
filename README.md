# ESPRR: Expected Solar Performance and Ramp Rate tool

ESPRR is an interactive web application to model expected power and ramp rates for new
solar PV plants in the Southwest while properly accounting for location, size,
orientation, and geographic diversity. The tool consists of a Vue web frontend backed by
a FastAPI backend to perform the calculations. ESPRR was initially developed with
support from Salt River Project.
